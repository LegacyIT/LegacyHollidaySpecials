Simple Stupid CS

This project is created for the LegacyHollidaySpecials. It aims to break some basic concepts in Computer Science as simply as the author can.

Once launched, you can click on 'start' to explore the computer science topics available.

The contents are wholly plaintext, meaning graphical contents are implemented as ascii art.

You can scroll contents vertically with the mouse or the scrollbars.

Please once a content is selected, make sure it is scrolled to the top-left corner (use the two scrollbars) - I did not have the time to fix the arbitrary scrolling of content after selection.

WARNING: The content has zero research and little-to-no proofreading. The
content is an attempt by the author demo his understanding of core Computer
Science kicks and tricks.
